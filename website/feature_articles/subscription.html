<p>New subscriptions (OsmAnd Pro and OsmAnd Maps+) became active from OsmAnd 4.0 (August 2021). All earlier subscriptions (OsmAnd Live) are legacy and technically equal to "OsmAnd Maps+ subscription", though legacy subscriptions are entitled to Hourly Map updates. Users can't buy legacy subscriptions but old subscriptions are automatically renewed until the user unsubscribes (the price for them might change in the future).</p>
